Scripts
=======

In this section, the executable scripts are documented. There is a chain of method scripts that
processes the WRF data to calculate, e.g., reflectivity with CR-SIM, shrinks the data to save
disk space, merges variables together, interpolates radar and model data to a joint grid and so on
and so on. All data processing scripts, how to execute them and in what order is described here:
:ref:`methods`. All scripts that are used for analysis and plotting are described here:
:ref:`analysis`.
