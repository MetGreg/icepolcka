# IcePolCKa
This is the repository intended for software used in the PhD project of Gregor KÃ¶cher that is part of the project 
"Investigation of the initiation of convection and the evolution of precipitation using simulations and 
polarimetric radar observations at C- and Ka-band" (IcePolCKa). In this project, polarimetric radar observations 
are used to evaluate weather simulations using varying cloud microphysics schemes. 
The current version of the code is related to a publication to be submitted under the title: 
'Influence of cloud microphysics schemes on weather model predictions of heavy precipitation'

## Installation
Almost all code is written in python. It is recommended to use anaconda to install python packages:
https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution .

Follow these steps to install the icepolcka package and all dependencies from scratch within a new 
python environment with anaconda. Execute the commands from within the top level icepolcka folder.

1. conda create -y name ice_env
2. conda activate ice_env
3. conda config --add channels conda-forge
4. conda install -y -file requirements.txt
5. cd icepolcka_utils
6. python setup.py install

## Documentation
All documentation, including installation and configuration as well as code documentation is 
done via sphinx. Create the sphinx autodocumentation with the following code from the top level
directory:

```
    make doc
```

The documentation will be created at:

    icepolcka/docs/build/index.html

Open this file with any browser to see the documentation.

> Sometimes, red warnings are shown. Not always this breaks the documentation. Check the index.html
