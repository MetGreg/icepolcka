# Configuration
Most of the scripts use a configuration file that defines some settings, e.g.
the time range of data to be used. This configuration file must be located in
an "icepolcka" subdirectory within the systems default configuration folder
(~/.config for linux). The name of the configuration file must be
"method_paper.yaml". An example configuration file is located within this
repository. 

# SQL Data base
The scripts access data via an SQL type of data base. If this data base does not
exist yet, it will be created which can take some time, depending on the amount
of data.
